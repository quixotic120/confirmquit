simple script to use with bettertouchtool or similar on osx for apps that don't confirm quit

pair with a key shortcut or gesture (typically command+q) for apps and when you quit it will confirm if you meant to do that.
for some reason safari on OSX does not have the option to do this and it is super irritating when I accidentally hit cmd+q instead of cmd+w
